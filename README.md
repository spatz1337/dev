# itsnebula.net

My personal site forked from [ven.earth](https://ven.earth) created with **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**.

## Getting Started

Once you've cloned the repository, install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Configuration

1. Open `.env.example` and modify the environment variables to the specified values.
2. Rename the file to `.env.local` once done.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy a Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
